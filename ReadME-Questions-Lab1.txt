Questions that occurred to me while doing Lab1:

            //Prof. Schurter: I thought strings could only be defined by declaring a certain
            //amount of memory AND THEN, could be given a multi-char value. Is this method
            //where one can declare a 'String.Empty' object without defining the memory-size
            //a recent feature of C#? And how often does one have to work with memory-allocation
            //in C#?

            //Also, what is a 'Dll'?

            //Prof Schurter: If a program is written using an older version of C# (say anything below v7)
            //would features in newer versions be available? For instance, setting 'int' as 'default' - could
            //such a method be used in C# 'version X < version 7'?

	    //What is the best strategy to evaluate [Yes/No] [True/False] [Y/N] from user input? ASking
	    //because 'Y' and 'N' aren't string which makes it harder to Parse them into a bool-value.
